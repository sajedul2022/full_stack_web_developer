		<h3 id="disclaimer"><strong>Disclaimer</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Although support is not required of ThemeForest authors, I do offer support for the theme and its core features and functionality. I cannot guarantee that this theme will function with all third-party components and plugins. Flex Mag Theme is presented as is.</p>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="installation"><strong>Installation/Homepage Setup</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<ol>
			<li>Make sure that you have the latest version of Wordpress installed.</li>
			<li>You can upload Flex Mag to Wordpress in one of two different ways:
				<ul>
					<li>Extract the <strong>flex-mag.zip</strong> and upload the extracted <strong>flex-mag</strong> folder to the <strong>/wp-content/themes/</strong> directory on your FTP server.</li>
					<li><strong>OR</strong> go to <strong>Appearance > Themes</strong> and click on the <strong>Add New</strong> link at the top. Then click <strong>Upload Theme</strong> and click <strong>Choose File</strong>, then select <strong>flexmag.zip</strong> and click <strong>Install Now</strong>.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>After you upload the theme, activate it by going to <strong>Appearance > Themes</strong> and place your mouse over <strong>Flex Mag</strong> and click the <strong>Activate</strong> button underneath.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>After installing the theme, you can import the XML data file (located in the XML Data folder of the original zip file), which will populate your theme with dummy posts, categories, tags, and menus. For more information about how to import Wordpress XML data, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Importing_Content" target="_blank">click here</a> and scroll down to the Wordpress section.</p>

		<p>NOTE: The XML data does not come with the images from the demo, which are not licensed to be included in the theme file.</p>

		<p>In order to utilize the Featured Posts section like in the demo, you will have to set up a static homepage by doing the following:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Go to <strong>Pages > Add New</strong>. Enter <strong>Home</strong> as the title and in the <strong>Page Attributes</strong> section, select <strong>Home</strong> from the <strong>Templates</strong> dropdown menu on the right. Click <strong>Publish</strong>.</li>
			<li>Go to <strong>Settings > Reading</strong> and select the <strong>A static page</strong> radio button and in the <strong>Front Page:</strong> dropdown menu, select <strong>Home</strong>. Click <strong>Save Changes</strong></li>
			<li>Go to <strong>Appearance > Flex Mag Options</strong> and click <strong>Reset Options</strong>.</li>
		</ol>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="update"><strong>Updating the Theme</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>From time to time, a theme update will be released that either fixes a bug and/or adds new features to the theme. You can update the theme in one of two ways:

		<ol>
			<li>Remove the old version of the theme by going to <strong>Appearance > Themes</strong> and activating another theme (you may want to place your site in Maintenance mode via a plugin). Then, hover your mouse over the Flex Mag theme image and click <strong>Theme Details</strong>. Then click <strong>delete</strong> in the lower right corner of the window that appears. Then, follow the installation instructions above to install the new version of the theme.</li>
			<li><strong>OR</strong> you can upload the new <strong>/flex-mag</strong> folder (located in the <strong>flex-mag.zip</strong> file) via FTP and overwrite the old files.</li>
		</ol>

		<p><strong style="color: #ef0000;">NOTE: Updating the theme will overwrite any changes you made to any of the core files (index.php, style.css, header.php, etc), however, you will not lose any changes you made to the Theme Options, menus, widgets, etc.</strong></p>

		<p><strong style="color: #ef0000;">Also, make sure to go to your Theme Options and click "Save all changes" after each time you update the theme to make sure any new options are generated properly.</strong></p>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="images"><strong>Images</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>Flex Mag supports retina-ready images. To utilize this feature, follow these instructions:

		<ol>
			<li>Create a second image that is twice the size of your existing image. For example, if your logo is 200x60, your retina image would need to be 400x100.
			<li>Add <strong>@2x</strong> to the end of the name of the retina image. For example, if your logo is called logo.png, name your retina version logo@2x.png.
			<li>Upload the retina image in the same directory as your non-retina image. For example, if your logo is located in <strong>/wp-content/themes/flex-mag/images/</strong>, you must upload the retina version in this directory.
			<li>That's it!</strong>
